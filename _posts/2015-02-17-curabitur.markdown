title: About Me
---
I'm currently a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate from School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://www.ee.buaa.edu.cn/info/1040/1172.htm">Wenrui Ding</a>. Before that, I received the B.E. degree in Communication Engineering in 2015 from Northwestern Polytechnical University.
My research interests lie in computer vision and machine learning, particularly in semantic segmentation, video segmentation and multi-task learning.

Now, I'm visiting <a href="http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/">Vision and Learning Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/">University of California, Merced</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/">Ming-Hsuan Yang</a>.
