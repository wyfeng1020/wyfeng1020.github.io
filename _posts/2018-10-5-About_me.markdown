title: About Me
---
I'm currently a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate from School of Electronics and Information Engineering, <a href="http://www.buaa.edu.cn">Beihang University</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://www.ee.buaa.edu.cn/info/1040/1172.htm">Wenrui Ding</a>. Before that, I received the B.E. degree in Communication Engineering in 2015 from <a href="http://www.nwpu.edu.cn/">Northwestern Polytechnical University</a>.

My research interests lie in computer vision and machine learning, particularly in semantic segmentation and video segmentation.

Now, I'm visiting <a href="http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/">Vision and Learning Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/">University of California, Merced</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/">Ming-Hsuan Yang</a>.
